## Advanced Negotiation Techniques

### Power Analysis

**Sources of Supplier Power:**
- Few alternatives (consolidated market)
- Switching costs (qualification, tooling)
- Proprietary technology or IP
- Capacity constraints (allocation)
- Strong BATNA (other customers)

**Sources of Buyer Power:**
- Large volume (% of supplier's revenue)
- Multiple alternatives (fragmented market)
- Low switching costs
- Backward integration capability
- Strong market knowledge

### Value Creation Negotiation

Move from "dividing the pie" to "expanding the pie":

**Traditional (Zero-Sum):**
- I win, you lose
- Focus on price only
- Adversarial relationship
- Short-term thinking

**Value Creation (Win-Win):**
- Identify mutual gains
- Multiple variables traded
- Partnership approach
- Long-term value

**Value Creation Opportunities:**

| Source | Buyer Benefit | Supplier Benefit |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| Volume consolidation | Lower prices | Scale/utilization |
| Longer contracts | Price stability | Revenue certainty |
| Forecast sharing | Better availability | Production planning |
| Joint VA/VE | Lower cost | Innovation showcase |
| Payment terms | Cash flow | Cash flow (inverse) |
| Specification flexibility | Cost reduction | Easier manufacturing |

### Tactical Negotiation Moves

**Opening:**
- Anchor high/low based on position
- Let them make first offer when uncertain
- Use silence after offers

**Middle Game:**
- Trade, don't concede
- "If you..., then I..."
- Bracket desired outcome
- Take notes, summarize progress

**Closing:**
- Summarize agreements
- Address all open items
- Avoid last-minute concessions
- Document in writing immediately

### Handling Difficult Situations

**When Supplier Has Power:**
- Demonstrate value as customer
- Develop alternatives (long-term)
- Seek creative solutions
- Maintain relationship for future

**When Supplier Uses Hardball:**
- Don't match aggression
- Name the tactic ("That sounds like take-it-or-leave-it")
- Return to interests
- Consider walking away

**When Impasse Occurs:**
- Reframe the problem
- Introduce new variables
- Suggest break/caucus
- Escalate appropriately

### TCO Calculation Example

**Scenario:** Two suppliers for same part

| Cost Element | Supplier A | Supplier B |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| Unit price | £10.00 | £9.50 |
| Annual volume | 100,000 | 100,000 |
| Base cost | £1,000,000 | £950,000 |
| | | |
| Freight (per unit) | £0.20 | £0.80 |
| Freight cost | £20,000 | £80,000 |
| | | |
| PPM (defects) | 50 | 200 |
| Cost per defect | £100 | £100 |
| Quality cost | £500 | £2,000 |
| | | |
| Lead time (days) | 5 | 21 |
| Safety stock (days) | 3 | 10 |
| Inventory value | £41,095 | £84,931 |
| Carrying cost (20%) | £8,219 | £16,986 |
| | | |
| **TCO** | **£1,028,719** | **£1,048,986** |
| **TCO per unit** | **£10.29** | **£10.49** |

**Conclusion:** Supplier A is cheaper despite higher unit price.

### Hidden Cost Identification

**Often Overlooked:**
- Transaction costs (PO processing, invoicing)
- Communication overhead (time zones, language)
- Travel for supplier management
- Specification interpretation errors
- Engineering change management
- Customs delays and broker fees

## Case Studies

### Case 1: Dual Sourcing Strategy

**Situation:** 100% spend with single supplier for critical casting. Supplier experiencing quality issues and requesting 15% price increase.

**Analysis:**
- Supplier knows they have leverage
- 18-month qualification for alternative
- Current PPM: 500 (unacceptable)
- No visibility into their cost structure

**Strategy:**
1. Began alternative qualification immediately (don't announce)
2. Conducted detailed should-cost analysis
3. Demanded quality improvement plan as condition of any increase
4. Offered 3-year contract at 3% increase IF quality targets met

**Outcome:**
- Supplier agreed to 5% increase with quality targets
- Alternative qualified within 12 months
- Shifted 30% of volume to new supplier
- Quality improved to <50 PPM with competition

**Lesson:** Never be hostage to single source. Time invested in alternatives pays back.

### Case 2: Total Cost Surprise

**Situation:** Procurement celebrated 20% price reduction by moving production to low-cost country supplier.

**Reality (18 months later):**
- Freight costs +8% of part value
- Inventory carrying cost +4% (longer lead time)
- Quality costs +3% (higher PPM)
- Expedite freight +2% (missed deliveries)
- Management time +1% (time zone issues)

**Actual Savings:** 2% (not 20%)

**Lesson:** Always calculate full TCO before sourcing decisions. Unit price is only part of the story.

### Case 3: Supplier Development ROI

**Situation:** Strategic supplier for precision machined components struggling with quality (800 PPM) and delivery (90% OTD).

**Investment:**
- Resident SQE for 6 months: £60,000
- Kaizen events (3): £15,000
- Training materials: £5,000
- Travel and expenses: £10,000
- **Total: £90,000**

**Returns (Annual):**
- PPM reduction (800→50): Saved £150,000 in quality costs
- OTD improvement (90%→98%): Saved £50,000 in expedites
- Capacity unlocked: Avoided £200,000 in second source costs
- VA/VE ideas implemented: £75,000 savings
- **Total Annual Benefit: £475,000**

**ROI:** 428% first year, ongoing benefits

**Lesson:** Supplier development is an investment with measurable returns, not a cost.
