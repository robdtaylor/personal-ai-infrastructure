## Audit Programme Management

### Programme vs Plan vs Schedule

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Programme | Overall approach to auditing | 3-year cycle, risk-based, all processes |
| Plan | Specific audit details | Scope, criteria, team, timing |
| Schedule | Calendar of audits | Q1: Machining, Q2: Assembly, etc. |

### Risk-Based Scheduling

**High Priority (Audit more frequently):**
- Processes with high customer impact
- Areas with recent nonconformances
- New or changed processes
- Customer complaint related areas
- Previous audit findings open
- High-risk PFMEA items

**Standard Priority:**
- Stable processes
- Good historical performance
- No recent changes
- No open corrective actions

### Coverage Matrix

Track audit coverage over the cycle:

| Process/Clause | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|----------------|--------|--------|--------|
| 4.1-4.4 Context | Q1 | - | Q1 |
| 5.1-5.3 Leadership | Q2 | - | Q2 |
| 6.1-6.3 Planning | - | Q1 | - |
| 7.1-7.5 Support | Q3 | Q2 | Q3 |
| 8.1-8.7 Operation | Q1-Q4 | Q1-Q4 | Q1-Q4 |
| 9.1-9.3 Performance | Q4 | Q3 | Q4 |
| 10.1-10.3 Improvement | Q4 | Q4 | Q4 |
| Machining | Q1, Q3 | Q2, Q4 | Q1, Q3 |
| Assembly | Q2, Q4 | Q1, Q3 | Q2, Q4 |
| Final Test | Q2, Q4 | Q1, Q3 | Q2, Q4 |

**2-4 Weeks Prior:**
1. Review scope and criteria
2. Assign audit team
3. Notify auditee
4. Schedule opening/closing meetings
5. Arrange logistics (room, access)

**1 Week Prior:**
1. Review previous audit results
2. Review relevant procedures
3. Check open corrective actions
4. Review recent quality data (scrap, complaints)
5. Prepare checklist
6. Review FMEA/Control Plans for area

**Day Before:**
1. Confirm schedule with auditee
2. Print/prepare documents
3. Review checklist
4. Confirm team members
5. Prepare audit kit

### Audit Kit

## Interview Techniques

### Opening Questions

Start broad, then narrow:
- "Can you explain your role in this process?"
- "Walk me through how this operation works"
- "What are the key quality requirements?"

### Probing Questions

Dig deeper into responses:
- "How do you know that?"
- "Can you show me evidence?"
- "What happens if X occurs?"
- "How was that verified?"

### Verification Questions

Confirm understanding:
- "So if I understand correctly..."
- "Let me summarize what you've said..."
- "Is this the document you're referring to?"

### Handling Difficult Situations

**Uncooperative auditee:**
- Stay professional and calm
- Explain audit purpose
- Escalate if necessary

**Overly helpful auditee:**
- Keep focused on scope
- Verify claims with evidence
- Don't accept verbal assurances alone

**Defensive auditee:**
- Acknowledge their perspective
- Focus on requirements
- Use evidence, not opinion

### Do's and Don'ts

**Do:**
- Ask open-ended questions
- Listen actively
- Take detailed notes
- Follow up on unclear answers
- Thank participants

**Don't:**
- Be confrontational
- Jump to conclusions
- Accept "we always do that" without evidence
- Audit outside scope
- Promise outcomes

## Evidence Collection and Documentation

### Types of Evidence

| Type | Description | Weight |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Documentary | Written records, procedures | High |
| Physical | Observation of conditions, products | High |
| Testimonial | Verbal statements from personnel | Medium |
| Analytical | Data analysis, trends | High |

### Evidence Quality

**Good evidence is:**
- Objective (fact-based)
- Verifiable (can be confirmed)
- Relevant (relates to requirement)
- Sufficient (enough to conclude)

**Weak evidence:**
- Hearsay
- Opinion
- Single isolated instance
- Unverifiable claim

### Note-Taking Best Practices

```
Observation: [What you saw/heard]
Document ID: [Reference number, revision]
Date/Time: [When observed]
Location: [Where]
Person: [Who provided information]
Requirement: [What standard requires]
Evaluation: [Conformance/Nonconformance/Unable to determine]
```

### Sampling Strategy

| Population | Sample Size | Rationale |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| <10 items | 100% | Small population |
| 10-50 items | 10 items | Representative |
| 50-100 items | 15 items | Statistical basis |
| >100 items | √n or 20 | Square root rule |

## Writing Effective Findings

### Finding Structure

Good findings include:
1. **Requirement**: What the standard/procedure requires
2. **Evidence**: What was observed (specific, objective)
3. **Conclusion**: How evidence shows nonconformance

### Examples

**Weak Finding:**
"Training records are incomplete"

**Strong Finding:**
"IATF 16949, clause 7.2, requires demonstration of competence. Review of training records for CNC operators in the Machine Shop revealed that 3 of 10 operators (names: X, Y, Z) had no documented training on the current revision (Rev C) of Work Instruction WI-MS-023 'CNC Lathe Operation'. The work instruction was revised on 2024-06-15, and no retraining was documented."

### Finding Categories

**Systemic Nonconformance:**
- Affects entire system
- Pattern across multiple instances
- Usually Major

**Process Nonconformance:**
- Specific to one process
- May be Major or Minor depending on impact

**Isolated Nonconformance:**
- Single instance
- Usually Minor

**Documentation Nonconformance:**
- Missing or inadequate documented information
- May be Major or Minor depending on impact

## Corrective Action Verification

### Verification Methods

| Method | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| Document review | Procedure changes, records |
| Re-audit | Process or systemic issues |
| Data review | Effectiveness of actions |
| Interview | Competence, awareness |

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] Root cause addresses actual cause, not symptom
- [ ] Corrective action targets root cause
- [ ] Action is implemented (not just planned)
- [ ] Evidence of implementation exists
- [ ] Effectiveness can be measured
- [ ] Recurrence has been prevented
- [ ] Similar areas have been checked

### Common Verification Issues

**Problem:** Action addresses symptom, not cause
**Solution:** Challenge root cause analysis, ask "why" again

**Problem:** Action is "retraining" only
**Solution:** Ask what prevents reoccurrence if operator leaves

**Problem:** No objective evidence of effectiveness
**Solution:** Define measurable success criteria
