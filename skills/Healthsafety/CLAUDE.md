## Risk Assessment Methodology

### Five Steps to Risk Assessment (HSE)

**Step 1: Identify Hazards**

Sources of information:
- Walk the workplace
- Review incident history
- Consult employees
- Check manufacturer instructions
- Review industry guidance

**Step 2: Decide Who Might Be Harmed**

| Group | Considerations |
|-------|----------------|
| Employees | Regular exposure, training level |
| Contractors | Unfamiliar with hazards |
| Visitors | No safety training |
| Vulnerable | Young workers, pregnant, disabled |
| Public | If affected by operations |

**Step 3: Evaluate Risks**

Risk evaluation matrix:

| Severity | Description | Score |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Catastrophic | Fatality, permanent disability | 5 |
| Major | Serious injury, long-term illness | 4 |
| Moderate | Medical treatment required | 3 |
| Minor | First aid treatment | 2 |
| Negligible | No injury | 1 |

| Likelihood | Description | Score |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| Almost certain | Expected to occur | 5 |
| Likely | Will probably occur | 4 |
| Possible | May occur | 3 |
| Unlikely | Not expected | 2 |
| Rare | Exceptional circumstances | 1 |

**Risk Score = Severity × Likelihood**

| Score | Risk Level | Action |
|-------|------------|--------|
| 17-25 | Critical | Stop work, immediate action |
| 10-16 | High | Urgent action required |
| 5-9 | Medium | Scheduled action |
| 1-4 | Low | Monitor and review |

**Step 4: Record Findings**

Document:
- Hazards identified
- Who is at risk
- Current controls
- Risk rating (before/after)
- Additional controls needed
- Action owner and deadline
- Review date

**Step 5: Review and Update**

Review triggers:
- After any incident
- After near miss
- When process changes
- When new equipment installed
- At scheduled review date
- When controls found ineffective

### Hierarchy of Controls

```
Most Effective
     ▲
     │  ┌─────────────────────┐
     │  │    ELIMINATION      │  Remove the hazard entirely
     │  └─────────────────────┘
     │  ┌─────────────────────┐
     │  │    SUBSTITUTION     │  Replace with less hazardous
     │  └─────────────────────┘
     │  ┌─────────────────────┐
     │  │    ENGINEERING      │  Isolate people from hazard
     │  └─────────────────────┘
     │  ┌─────────────────────┐
     │  │   ADMINISTRATIVE    │  Change the way people work
     │  └─────────────────────┘
     │  ┌─────────────────────┐
     │  │        PPE          │  Protect the worker
     ▼  └─────────────────────┘
Least Effective
```

## Incident Investigation Techniques

### Investigation Process

**Immediate Response (0-4 hours):**
1. Ensure scene is safe
2. Provide first aid / call emergency services
3. Preserve the scene (photos, notes)
4. Identify witnesses
5. Notify management
6. Complete initial incident report

**Investigation (24-72 hours):**
1. Gather physical evidence
2. Interview witnesses (separately)
3. Review documentation
4. Timeline reconstruction
5. Identify immediate and root causes
6. Determine contributing factors

### 5 Whys Analysis

**Example - Slip injury:**

| Why | Question | Answer |
|-----|----------|--------|
| 1 | Why did they slip? | Floor was wet |
| 2 | Why was floor wet? | Coolant leaked from machine |
| 3 | Why did coolant leak? | Hose connection failed |
| 4 | Why did connection fail? | Hose was worn and not replaced |
| 5 | Why wasn't it replaced? | No PM schedule for hose inspection |

**Root Cause:** Preventive maintenance programme doesn't include coolant hose inspection.

```

**Categories to investigate:**
- **People:** Training, supervision, fatigue, procedures followed
- **Methods:** Work procedures, risk assessment, permits
- **Materials:** Condition, specification, storage
- **Machines:** Condition, guarding, maintenance
- **Environment:** Lighting, housekeeping, weather
- **Measurement:** Inspection, monitoring, calibration

### Interview Techniques

**PEACE Model:**
- **P**lanning and preparation
- **E**ngage and explain
- **A**ccount (obtain)
- **C**losure
- **E**valuation

**Good Practice:**
- Interview promptly (memory fades)
- Interview separately
- Use open questions
- Let them tell their story
- Don't lead or suggest
- Take contemporaneous notes
- Thank them for cooperation

## COSHH Deep Dive

### COSHH Assessment Process

**Step 1: Identify Substances**

| Substance Type | Examples |
|----------------|----------|
| Process chemicals | Cutting fluids, degreasers |
| By-products | Fumes, dust, mists |
| Biological | Legionella (cooling towers) |

**Step 2: Assess Exposure**

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| Route | Inhalation, skin, ingestion |
| Duration | How long exposed |
| Frequency | How often |
| Concentration | Level of exposure |

**Step 3: Determine Controls**

Control hierarchy for COSHH:
1. Eliminate substance
2. Substitute less hazardous
3. Enclose process
4. Local exhaust ventilation (LEV)
5. General ventilation
6. Reduce exposure time
7. PPE (last resort)

**Step 4: Implement and Maintain**

| Control | Maintenance Required |
|---------|---------------------|
| LEV | 14-monthly thorough examination |
| RPE | Fit testing, maintenance |
| PPE | Regular inspection, replacement |
| Procedures | Review and update |

### Workplace Exposure Limits (WELs)

**Example WELs (UK):**

| Substance | 8-hour TWA | STEL (15 min) |
|-----------|------------|---------------|

| Welding fume | 4 mg/m³ | - |
| Toluene | 50 ppm | 100 ppm |
| Isopropanol | 400 ppm | 500 ppm |

**Monitoring Requirements:**
- When assessment indicates risk
- After control changes
- At defined intervals
- Records retained 40 years

### Health Surveillance

**When Required:**
- Exposure to specified substances
- Where valid technique available
- Reasonable likelihood of disease
- Surveillance will detect condition

**Common Surveillance:**
| Exposure | Surveillance |
|----------|--------------|
| Cutting fluids | Skin checks, questionnaire |
| Noise | Audiometry |
| Hand-arm vibration | Questionnaire, physical exam |
| Welding fume | Respiratory questionnaire |
