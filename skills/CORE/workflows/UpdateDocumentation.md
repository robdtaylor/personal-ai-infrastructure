# UpdateDocumentation Workflow

> **Trigger:** "update architecture", "refresh PAI state", OR automatically after any pack/bundle installation

## Purpose

Keeps PAI Architecture tracking current by:
1. Regenerating the Architecture.md file with current installation state
2. Logging upgrades to the history system
3. Verifying system health after changes

## When This Runs

### Manual Invocation
- User says "update my PAI architecture"
- User says "refresh PAI state"
- User says "what's installed?"

### Automatic Invocation (CRITICAL)
**This workflow MUST run automatically after:**
- Installing any PAI Pack
- Installing any PAI Bundle
- Making significant configuration changes
- Upgrading pack versions

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Regenerate Architecture

```bash
bun run $PAI_DIR/Tools/PaiArchitecture.ts generate
```

### Step 2: Log the Change (If Applicable)

If this was triggered by an installation or upgrade:

```bash
# For pack installations
bun run $PAI_DIR/Tools/PaiArchitecture.ts log-upgrade "Installed [pack-name] v[version]" pack

# For bundle installations
bun run $PAI_DIR/Tools/PaiArchitecture.ts log-upgrade "Installed [bundle-name] bundle" bundle

# For config changes
bun run $PAI_DIR/Tools/PaiArchitecture.ts log-upgrade "[description of change]" config
```

### Step 3: Verify Health

```bash
bun run $PAI_DIR/Tools/PaiArchitecture.ts check
```

### Step 4: Report Status

Output the current architecture state to confirm the update was successful.

## Integration with Pack Installation

**All pack installation workflows should include this at the end:**

```markdown
## Post-Installation: Update Documentation

After all installation steps complete:

1. Run UpdateDocumentation workflow
2. Log the pack installation
3. Verify the pack appears in Architecture.md

\`\`\`bash
# Auto-run after pack installation
bun run $PAI_DIR/Tools/PaiArchitecture.ts log-upgrade "Installed [pack-name] v[version]" pack
bun run $PAI_DIR/Tools/PaiArchitecture.ts generate
\`\`\`
```

## Example Output

```
📋 SUMMARY: Updated PAI Architecture documentation
⚡ ACTIONS:
  - Regenerated Architecture.md
  - Logged upgrade: "Installed pai-voice-system v1.0.0"
  - Verified system health
✅ RESULTS: Architecture.md now shows 4 packs, 1 bundle
📊 STATUS: All systems healthy
🎯 COMPLETED: Architecture updated - 4 packs installed, all healthy.
```
