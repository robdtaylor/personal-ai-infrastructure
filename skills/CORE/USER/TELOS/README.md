# TELOS Framework

**TELOS** (Greek: τέλος) means "end, purpose, goal" - the ultimate aim of something.

This framework captures deep personal context so your AI can:
- Prioritize based on your actual goals
- Suggest based on your strategies
- Warn when something conflicts with your beliefs
- Connect today's task to your bigger picture

## Conceptual Flow

```
PROBLEMS → MISSION → NARRATIVES → GOALS → CHALLENGES → STRATEGIES → PROJECTS → JOURNAL
    ↑                                                                              ↓
    └──────────────────────────── feedback loop ───────────────────────────────────┘
```

Any project you're working on should trace back through this chain to the problems you're trying to solve.

## Files

| File | Purpose | Update Frequency |
|------|---------|------------------|
| `PROBLEMS.md` | What's broken in the world that you care about | Rarely (fundamental) |
| `MISSION.md` | Your overarching life purpose | Rarely |
| `NARRATIVES.md` | Stories you tell about yourself and your journey | Occasionally |
| `GOALS.md` | Specific targets you're working toward | Monthly |
| `CHALLENGES.md` | Obstacles stopping you from progress | Weekly |
| `STRATEGIES.md` | Concrete approaches to your challenges | Monthly |
| `PROJECTS.md` | Active work items with status | Weekly |
| `BELIEFS.md` | Core beliefs guiding your decisions | Occasionally |
| `JOURNAL.md` | Timestamped progress and reflections | Daily/Weekly |

## How Your AI Uses This

When you ask for help, your AI can:

1. **Check alignment**: "This task supports G2 (your goal to...)"
2. **Warn conflicts**: "This approach conflicts with your belief about..."
3. **Suggest strategies**: "Based on S3, you might try..."
4. **Track progress**: "This completes P4, which addresses C2"

## Getting Started

1. Start with `PROBLEMS.md` - What matters to you?
2. Define your `MISSION.md` - Why are you here?
3. Fill in the rest as you discover clarity
4. Review monthly to keep aligned
