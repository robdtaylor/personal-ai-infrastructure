# TELOS - Deep Personal Context

Your AI uses this framework to understand not just WHAT you're doing, but WHY.

## Framework Files

Located in `TELOS/` directory:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `README.md` | Framework overview and usage |
| `PROBLEMS.md` | What's broken in the world that you care about |
| `MISSION.md` | Your overarching life purpose |
| `NARRATIVES.md` | Stories you tell about yourself |
| `GOALS.md` | Specific targets you're working toward |
| `CHALLENGES.md` | Obstacles stopping your progress |
| `STRATEGIES.md` | Concrete approaches to challenges |
| `PROJECTS.md` | Active work items |
| `BELIEFS.md` | Core beliefs guiding decisions |
| `JOURNAL.md` | Timestamped progress tracking |

## Conceptual Flow

```
PROBLEMS → MISSION → GOALS → CHALLENGES → STRATEGIES → PROJECTS
                ↓
           NARRATIVES (context)
                ↓
            BELIEFS (guardrails)
                ↓
            JOURNAL (record)
```

## How AI Uses This

When you ask for help, your AI can:
- **Check alignment**: "This supports G2 (your goal to...)"
- **Warn conflicts**: "This conflicts with belief B1..."
- **Suggest strategies**: "Based on S3, consider..."
- **Track progress**: "This completes PRJ4, advancing G1"

## Quick Start

1. Read `TELOS/README.md`
2. Start with `PROBLEMS.md` - what matters to you?
3. Define `MISSION.md` - why are you here?
4. Fill in the rest as clarity emerges
5. Update `JOURNAL.md` regularly
