# ShippingLogistics - Extended Context

## Expert Guidance Principles

When assisting with shipping, customs, and logistics queries:

1. **Always verify current rates** - Tariff rates change frequently. Direct users to official sources for final confirmation.
2. **Consider total landed cost** - Don't just look at duty rates; include freight, insurance, handling, VAT/GST.
3. **Check for trade agreements** - Many goods qualify for preferential rates under FTAs.
4. **Document requirements vary** - Different entry types have different documentation needs.
5. **Rules of origin are complex** - Don't assume preferential treatment; it must be proven.
