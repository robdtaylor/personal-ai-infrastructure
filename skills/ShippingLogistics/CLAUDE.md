# ShippingLogistics - Extended Context

## Dual-Perspective Guidance (CRITICAL)

**Every tariff, customs, and trade compliance response MUST include both Conservative and Aggressive views.**

### Why Two Perspectives?

Trade compliance exists on a spectrum. The same facts can support multiple legitimate positions:
- **Conservative**: What a cautious compliance officer would do (minimise audit risk)
- **Aggressive**: What a strategic trade consultant would explore (minimise duty cost)

Neither is inherently right or wrong. The best approach depends on:
- Company risk tolerance
- Transaction value/volume
- Existing compliance track record
- Strategic importance of the trade route
- Available resources to defend positions

### Example: Steel Bracket Classification

**Facts:** Importing steel mounting brackets for automotive seats from Mexico to US.

**🛡️ Conservative View:**
> Classify under 8708.99.8180 (other motor vehicle parts) at 2.5% MFN duty. Given Section 232 steel tariffs, also declare steel content and apply 25% derivative tariff unless CUSMA certification obtained. Total duty exposure: 27.5%.
>
> *Rationale: Safest classification. No risk of penalty for misclassification.*

**🚀 Aggressive View:**
> Classify under 9401.90.1085 (seat parts) at 0% duty. Obtain CUSMA certificate showing 75%+ RVC to avoid Section 232 tariffs entirely. Request supplier declaration confirming Mexican steel/aluminum sourcing to satisfy melt-and-pour requirements. Total duty: 0%.
>
> *Rationale: Seat parts classification defensible based on primary function. CUSMA eliminates Section 232 if properly documented.*

**⚖️ Recommendation:**
> For ongoing production volumes, pursue the aggressive position with proper documentation. Request binding ruling from CBP to lock in 9401 classification. One-time administrative cost yields permanent duty savings.

### Example: UK-EU Rules of Origin

**Facts:** UK company imports German-made automotive sensors, adds UK wiring harness, exports to EU customer.

**🛡️ Conservative View:**
> Without detailed BOM analysis, assume the sensor does not undergo sufficient transformation in UK. Export to EU without EUR.1, customer pays MFN duty (typically 3-4.5%). Avoid risk of origin fraud penalties.
>
> *Rationale: UK processing may be insufficient for tariff shift. Better to let customer claim back if they can prove origin.*

**🚀 Aggressive View:**
> Analyse value-add in UK. If UK content (labour, wiring harness, packaging, testing) exceeds 50% ex-works price, goods may qualify as UK origin under TCA cumulation rules. Issue supplier declaration, customer claims zero duty.
>
> *Rationale: TCA allows EU content to count toward UK origin. Combined UK+German content likely meets threshold.*

**⚖️ Recommendation:**
> Run the RVC calculation. If marginal (45-55%), conservative approach safer. If clearly >55% UK+EU content, issue declaration with supporting documentation.

## Expert Guidance Principles

When assisting with shipping, customs, and logistics queries:

1. **Always provide both perspectives** - Conservative for risk mitigation, Aggressive for cost optimisation.
2. **Always verify current rates** - Tariff rates change frequently. Direct users to official sources for final confirmation.
3. **Consider total landed cost** - Don't just look at duty rates; include freight, insurance, handling, VAT/GST.
4. **Check for trade agreements** - Many goods qualify for preferential rates under FTAs.
5. **Document requirements vary** - Different entry types have different documentation needs.
6. **Rules of origin are complex** - Don't assume preferential treatment; it must be proven.

## Detailed Country Guides

### United Kingdom

#### HMRC Import Procedures

**Standard Imports:**
1. Obtain EORI number (starts with GB)
2. Classify goods using UK Trade Tariff
3. Determine customs procedure code (CPC)
4. Submit import declaration via CDS
5. Pay duty and VAT (or defer)
