2. **Determine origin** for preferential treatment
3. **Calculate duties**: Customs Duty + VAT + Excise (if applicable)
4. **Prepare documentation**: Commercial invoice, packing list, certificate of origin
5. **Submit declaration**: Via Customs Declaration Service (CDS)

### UK-EU Trade (TCA)

- Zero tariffs on goods meeting **rules of origin**
- Proof of origin required (supplier declaration or EUR.1)
- Full customs declarations required since 2021

### Common UK Automotive Duty Rates

| Product | Commodity Code | MFN Rate | EU (TCA) |
|---------|----------------|----------|----------|
| Passenger cars | 8703.xx | 10% | 0% |
| Car parts (general) | 8708.xx | 2.5-4.5% | 0% |
| Tires | 4011.xx | 4.5% | 0% |
| Batteries (EV) | 8507.60 | 2.7% | 0% |

## Incoterms 2020

### Commonly Used Terms

| Term | Full Name | Seller's Responsibility |
|------|-----------|------------------------|
| **EXW** | Ex Works | Goods at seller's premises |
| **FCA** | Free Carrier | Delivered to carrier |
| **FOB** | Free On Board | Loaded on vessel (sea only) |
| **CIF** | Cost, Insurance, Freight | Insurance + freight to port |
| **DDP** | Delivered Duty Paid | All costs including duties |

### Automotive Industry Standard

Most automotive OEM contracts use:
- **DDP** or **DAP** for finished vehicles
- **FCA** or **CIF** for parts
- **EXW** rarely used (shifts too much risk to buyer)

---

## Landed Cost Calculation

### Formula

```
Landed Cost = Product Cost + Freight + Insurance + Customs Duty + Taxes + Handling
```

### Detailed Breakdown

```
Product Cost (FOB)                    $10,000
+ International Freight                  $800
+ Insurance (0.5% of CIF)                $55
= CIF Value                          $10,855
+ Customs Duty (4.5%)                   $489
= Duty Paid Value                    $11,344
+ VAT/GST (20% UK / 5% Canada)        $2,269
+ Brokerage/Handling                    $150
= Total Landed Cost                  $13,763
```

## Documentation Requirements

### Standard Import Documents

| Document | UK | US | Canada |
|----------|----|----|--------|
| Commercial Invoice | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Packing List | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Bill of Lading/Airway Bill | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Certificate of Origin | If claiming preference | If claiming preference | If claiming preference |

### Automotive-Specific Documents

- **CUSMA Certificate of Origin**: For US/Canada/Mexico preferential treatment
- **EUR.1 Movement Certificate**: For UK-EU preferential treatment
- **Supplier Declaration**: Long-term or single shipment
- **IMDS/REACH Compliance**: Material declarations
- **PPAP Documentation**: When required by customer

---

## Rules of Origin

### Key Concepts

1. **Wholly Obtained**: Entirely produced in one country
2. **Substantial Transformation**: Tariff shift rule (change in HS heading)
3. **Regional Value Content (RVC)**: Percentage of value from region

### RVC Calculation Methods

**Transaction Value Method:**
```
RVC = ((TV - VNM) / TV) × 100
```
- TV = Transaction value
- VNM = Value of non-originating materials

**Net Cost Method:**
```
RVC = ((NC - VNM) / NC) × 100
```
- NC = Net cost (total cost minus royalties, shipping, packing)

### CUSMA Automotive RVC Requirements

| Product | 2020-2023 | 2024+ |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Passenger vehicles | 75% | 75% |
| Light trucks | 75% | 75% |
| Heavy trucks | 70% | 70% |
| Auto parts (core) | 75% | 75% |
| Auto parts (other) | 65-70% | 65-75% |
