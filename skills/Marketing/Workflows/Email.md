## Email Components

### Subject Lines

**Formulas:**
```
[Number] + [Adjective] + [Benefit]
"7 Simple Ways to Double Your Productivity"

[Curiosity Gap]
"The mistake I made that cost me 3 clients"

[Direct Benefit]
"Get 20% more done without working longer"

[Personal + Question]
"[Name], quick question about your [topic]"

[Urgency]
"[Hours/Days] left to [benefit]"
```

**Testing Framework:**
```
Test these elements:
- Length (short vs. detailed)
- Personalization (name vs. no name)
- Emoji (with vs. without)
- Question vs. statement
- Specificity (numbers vs. vague)
```

### Preview Text
```
- Extends the subject line (don't repeat it)
- 40-90 characters ideal
- Hook that creates curiosity
- Can be the first line of email body
```

### Body Structure

**The PASTOR Email:**
```
P - Problem: Open with their pain (1-2 sentences)
A - Amplify: What happens if unsolved (2-3 sentences)
S - Story: Brief narrative (3-4 sentences)
T - Transformation: What's possible (2-3 sentences)
O - Offer: Your solution (2-3 sentences)
R - Response: CTA (1-2 sentences)
```

**The Value Email:**
```
Hook: Pattern interrupt or bold statement
Value: 1-3 actionable insights
Proof: Example or case study
Bridge: Connection to your offer (optional)
CTA: Next step (even if just "reply")
```

### CTAs

**Primary CTA Placement:**
```
- After problem/solution presented
- After social proof
- At the natural decision point
- End of email (always)
```

**CTA Best Practices:**
```
- One primary CTA per email
- Button + text link for redundancy
- Action verb + benefit
- Visible without scrolling (above fold)
```
