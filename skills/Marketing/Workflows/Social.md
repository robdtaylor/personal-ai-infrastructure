    formats: [how-to, tips, tutorials, myths]

    formats: [stories, quotes, transformations]

    formats: [memes, behind-scenes, humor]
```

## Post Frameworks

### The Hook Formula
```
Line 1: Pattern interrupt (stop the scroll)
Line 2: Promise or curiosity gap
Line 3+: Deliver value
Last line: CTA or engagement prompt
```

### LinkedIn Carousel Structure
```
Slide 1: Bold statement/hook + topic
Slide 2: Problem or "most people think..."
Slide 3-8: Main points (one per slide)
Slide 9: Summary/recap
Slide 10: CTA + follow prompt
```

### Twitter Thread Structure
```
Tweet 1: Hook + promise ("Here's what I learned...")
Tweet 2-9: One insight per tweet
Tweet 10: Summary + CTA
Final: "Follow for more [topic]" + retweet ask
```

### Story Framework (Instagram/LinkedIn)
```
Frame 1: Hook question or statement
Frame 2-3: Set the scene
Frame 4-5: The challenge/conflict
Frame 6-7: The turning point
Frame 8: The lesson
Frame 9: CTA (poll, question, swipe up)
```

## Engagement Tactics

### Comment Starters
```
- Controversial opinion: "Unpopular take: [statement]"
- Question: "What's your biggest [topic] challenge?"
- Poll: "A or B?"
- Fill in blank: "[Topic] is ___"
- This or that: "Reply with [emoji] if [option A], [emoji] if [option B]"
```

### Reply Strategy
```
1. Reply within 1 hour (algorithm boost)
2. Ask follow-up questions
3. Add value in replies (not just "thanks!")
4. Reply to comments with threads
5. Pin best comments
```
