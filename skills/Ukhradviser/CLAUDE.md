## Employment Law Fundamentals

### Key Concepts

#### Employment Status
**Employee** - Most rights, including unfair dismissal (2+ years service)
**Worker** - Some rights (NMW, holiday pay, whistleblowing protection)
**Self-employed** - Minimal employment rights

**Tests:**
- **Control** - How much control over how work is done?
- **Mutuality of obligation** - Obligation to offer/accept work?
- **Personal service** - Must do work personally or can substitute?
- **Integration** - Part of the organization?
- **Economic reality** - In business on own account?

#### Continuous Employment
**Importance:** Qualification for statutory rights
- Unfair dismissal: 2 years (most cases)
- Statutory redundancy pay: 2 years
- Some discrimination claims: No qualifying period

**Continuity preserved:**
- Absence due to sickness/injury (up to 26 weeks)
- Pregnancy/maternity
- Temporary cessation of work
- Custom or arrangement
- TUPE transfers

#### Qualifying Periods
**Key thresholds:**
- **Day 1:** Discrimination claims, whistleblowing, health & safety detriment, family rights
- **1 month:** Minimum notice period
- **2 years:** Unfair dismissal, statutory redundancy pay
- **26 weeks:** Flexible working request

### Burden of Proof

**Unfair Dismissal:**
1. **Employee:** Prove dismissal occurred (or constructive dismissal)
2. **Employer:** Show potentially fair reason for dismissal
3. **Tribunal:** Assess whether dismissal was reasonable (band of reasonable responses test)

**Discrimination:**
1. **Claimant:** Prove facts from which discrimination could be inferred (prima facie case)
2. **Burden shifts to respondent:** Prove non-discriminatory explanation
3. **Tribunal:** Decide on balance of probabilities

### Time Limits

**Critical deadlines:**
- **Unfair dismissal / discrimination:** 3 months minus 1 day from act complained of
- **Unlawful deductions:** 3 months from last deduction (series of deductions: 3 months from last)
- **Redundancy payment:** 6 months from dismissal

**ACAS Early Conciliation:**
- Stops the clock while active (up to 1 month, extendable to 6 weeks)
- Must notify ACAS before tribunal claim
- Extensions automatically calculated

---

## Dismissal Procedures

### Types of Dismissal

#### 1. Summary Dismissal (Gross Misconduct)
**No notice given** - For conduct so serious it fundamentally breaches contract

**Examples of gross misconduct:**
- Theft, fraud, dishonesty
- Physical violence or bullying
- Serious insubordination
- Being under influence of alcohol/drugs at work
- Serious breach of health & safety
- Serious breach of confidentiality

**Procedure:**
1. Suspend on full pay (if investigation needed)
2. Investigate thoroughly
3. Disciplinary hearing (ACAS Code)
4. Decision: Summary dismissal if proven
5. Right of appeal

**Risk:** Tribunal will scrutinize heavily. Must be genuinely gross misconduct and procedure must be fair.

#### 2. Dismissal with Notice
**Notice period given** - For conduct, capability, or SOSR not amounting to gross misconduct

**Notice entitlements:**
- **Statutory minimum:** 1 week per year of service (max 12 weeks)
- **Contractual notice:** Whatever is in contract (often longer)
- **Pay in lieu of notice (PILON):** If contract allows

#### 3. Constructive Dismissal
**Employee resigns in response to employer's repudiatory breach**

**Requirements:**
1. Fundamental breach of contract by employer
2. Employee resigns in response (not affirms breach)
3. Doesn't delay unreasonably

**Common breaches:**
- Unilateral reduction in pay
- Demotion without agreement
- Failing to address serious grievance
- Bullying/harassment by employer

**Employee must:**
- Resign explicitly (in response to breach)
- Not affirm the breach (continuing to work normally may affirm)
- Act promptly

### Fair Reasons for Dismissal

**Only 5 potentially fair reasons (Employment Rights Act 1996, s.98):**

#### 1. Capability or Qualifications
- **Capability:** Skill, aptitude, health, or physical/mental qualities
- **Qualifications:** Degree, diploma, or other academic/technical qualification

**Procedure:**
- Capability (performance): Warnings, improvement plan, support, review
- Capability (health): Medical evidence, consider adjustments, consult employee
- Qualifications: Verify requirement, check if misleading at recruitment

#### 2. Conduct
- Misconduct (not gross): Warnings progression
- Gross misconduct: Potential summary dismissal
- Examples: Timekeeping, unauthorized absence, minor insubordination, breach of policies

**Procedure:**
- Investigate
- Disciplinary hearing (ACAS Code)
- Sanction proportionate to offense
- Right of appeal

#### 3. Redundancy
- Business closure
- Workplace closure
- Reduced need for employees of that kind

**Procedure:**
- Consultation (meaningful)
- Fair selection criteria
- Consider alternatives (redeployment)
- Redundancy pay (if 2+ years service)

#### 4. Statutory Restriction
- Employee can't legally continue working
- Example: Driver loses driving license

**Procedure:**
- Verify the restriction
- Consider alternatives (different role?)
- Consultation

#### 5. Some Other Substantial Reason (SOSR)
- Catch-all for reasons not fitting above
- Examples: Business reorganization, personality clashes (rare), breakdown of trust

**Procedure:**
- Depends on specific reason
- Must still be fair and reasonable

### Reasonableness Test

**Section 98(4) ERA 1996:** Was dismissal fair or unfair?

**Tribunal considers:**
1. Did employer act reasonably in treating reason as sufficient?
2. Considering:
   - Size and administrative resources of employer
   - Equity
   - Substantial merits of the case

**"Band of Reasonable Responses" test:**
- Not whether tribunal would have dismissed
- Whether dismissal was within range of reasonable responses
- Tribunal must not substitute its own view

**Factors affecting reasonableness:**
- Investigation quality (Burchell test: reasonable investigation, reasonable belief in guilt, reasonable decision to dismiss)
- Procedural fairness (ACAS Code followed?)
- Consistency (similar cases treated similarly?)
- Warnings given (for performance/conduct)
- Alternatives considered (especially redundancy)

### ACAS Code of Practice

**Applies to:** Disciplinary and grievance procedures

**Failure to follow:** Up to 25% uplift or reduction in compensation

**Key requirements:**
1. **Establish facts** - Investigate before hearing
2. **Inform employee** - Tell them issue, give them time to prepare
3. **Hold hearing** - Allow employee to state their case, accompanied if wished
4. **Decide on action** - Decide and inform employee
5. **Allow appeal** - Employee has right to appeal

**Right to be accompanied:**
- Worker or trade union official
- Not a lawyer (unless employer agrees)
- Can address hearing, confer, but not answer questions on employee's behalf

## Disciplinary & Grievance

### Disciplinary Procedure (ACAS Code)

#### Stage 1: Allegation/Issue Arises
**Action:**
- Don't rush to disciplinary
- Consider: Informal chat? Training needed? Policy clarification?

   - Review relevant policies
   - CCTV footage if applicable
3. **Investigation report:**
   - Facts found
   - Evidence considered
   - Recommendation: No case / Informal action / Disciplinary hearing

**Key:** Reasonable investigation, not exhaustive. Standard: reasonable belief based on reasonable investigation.

#### Stage 3: Disciplinary Hearing Invitation
**Letter must include:**

Further to your disciplinary hearing on [date], I am writing to confirm the outcome.

After careful consideration of all the evidence and your representations, I have decided that [allegation] is proven.

Outcome: First Written Warning

This warning will remain on your file for [6/12] months from the date of this letter.

**Common:** Employee facing disciplinary raises grievance about treatment

**Approach:**
- Consider whether grievance is relevant to disciplinary
- If closely related: May need to address grievance first
- If separate issue: Can progress both in parallel
- Always consider: Is this victimization? Raising grievance is protected act

#### Suspension
**When appropriate:**
- Serious allegation needing investigation
- Risk of evidence tampering
- Risk to others
- Already occurred (pending investigation)

**Requirements:**
- Full pay (unless contract says otherwise)
- Not punitive
- Confirm in writing
- Review regularly
- Keep as short as possible

**Letter:**

```
Dear [Employee],

Suspension on Full Pay - Pending Investigation

Following [incident/allegation] on [date], I am writing to inform you that you are suspended on full pay with immediate effect pending an investigation.

This suspension is not disciplinary action. It is a precautionary measure while we investigate the matter fully.

## Discrimination Law

### Protected Characteristics (Equality Act 2010)

**Nine protected characteristics:**
1. **Age** - Any age (no lower limit)
2. **Disability** - Physical or mental impairment with substantial and long-term effect
3. **Gender reassignment** - Person undergoing, has undergone, or proposes to undergo gender reassignment
4. **Marriage and civil partnership** - Protection from discrimination only (not harassment/victimization)
5. **Pregnancy and maternity** - Pregnancy and 26 weeks after birth (52 weeks protection)
6. **Race** - Color, nationality, ethnic or national origins
7. **Religion or belief** - Any religion, philosophical belief, or lack of belief
8. **Sex** - Male or female
9. **Sexual orientation** - Heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual

### Types of Discrimination

#### 1. Direct Discrimination (s.13)
**Definition:** Less favorable treatment because of protected characteristic

**Test:** Would person have been treated differently but for the protected characteristic?

**Example:** Not shortlisting candidate because of their age

**Defense:** NONE (except age - proportionate means to legitimate aim)

**Comparator:** Actual or hypothetical person without the characteristic

#### 2. Indirect Discrimination (s.19)
**Definition:** Provision, criterion, or practice (PCP) that:
- Applies to everyone
- Puts people with protected characteristic at particular disadvantage
- Puts claimant at that disadvantage
- Employer can't objectively justify

**Example:** Requiring full-time working (may indirectly discriminate against women)

**Defense:** Proportionate means of achieving legitimate aim

**Test:**
1. Is it a PCP?
2. Does it disadvantage group with protected characteristic?
3. Does it disadvantage the claimant?
4. Can employer justify? (Legitimate aim + proportionate means)

#### 3. Harassment (s.26)
**Definition:** Unwanted conduct related to protected characteristic that:
- Violates dignity, OR
- Creates intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating, or offensive environment

**Key points:**
- Subjective (claimant's perception) + objective (reasonable to create effect)
- Single incident can be harassment
- Third party harassment abolished 2013 (but can use other claims)

**Example:** Sexual comments, racist jokes, disability-related "banter"

#### 4. Victimization (s.27)
**Definition:** Less favorable treatment because person:
- Did protected act (brought claim, gave evidence, alleged discrimination)
- Or employer believes they will do protected act

**Protected acts:**
- Bringing discrimination proceedings
- Giving evidence/information in connection with proceedings
- Doing anything else in connection with the Act
- Making allegation of breach of the Act

**Example:** Not promoting someone because they raised race discrimination grievance

### Disability Discrimination - Special Rules

#### Definition of Disability (Equality Act s.6)
**Physical or mental impairment with:**
- Substantial (more than minor or trivial) adverse effect
- Long-term (12 months+ or likely to recur)
- On ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities

**Deemed disabilities:**
- Cancer, HIV, multiple sclerosis (from diagnosis)
- Sight impairment (certified blind/partially sighted)
- Past disabilities (if met definition when they had it)

#### Reasonable Adjustments (s.20)
**Three requirements:**

**1. PCP Duty:** Where PCP puts disabled person at substantial disadvantage, take reasonable steps to avoid disadvantage

**2. Physical Feature Duty:** Where physical feature puts disabled person at substantial disadvantage, take reasonable steps (remove, alter, avoid feature)

**3. Auxiliary Aid Duty:** Provide auxiliary aid where disabled person would be at substantial disadvantage without it

**"Reasonable" factors (s.20):**
- Effectiveness in preventing disadvantage
- Practicability
- Cost
- Extent of employer's resources
- Availability of external assistance

**Examples:**
- Adjusting work hours/duties
- Allowing home working
- Providing special equipment
- Modifying procedures for testing/assessment
- Reallocating duties
- Altering premises

**Failure to make adjustment:** Discrimination (can't justify)

#### Pre-Employment Health Questions
**Restricted (Equality Act s.60):**
Can't ask about health BEFORE offering job (or putting in pool for selection)

**Exceptions:**
- Necessary to determine if claimant can carry out intrinsic function
- Monitoring (diversity)
- Positive action
- Occupational requirement

**After conditional offer:** Can ask health questions

### Pregnancy and Maternity

#### Automatic Unfair Dismissal Reasons (ERA 1996 s.99)
**Dismissal automatically unfair if reason (or principal reason) is:**
- Pregnancy
- Childbirth
- Maternity leave
- Other prescribed reasons (e.g., health and safety suspension while pregnant)

**No qualifying period needed**

#### Pregnancy Discrimination
**During pregnancy and ordinary/additional maternity leave:**
- Less favorable treatment because of pregnancy = direct discrimination (no comparator needed)

**After return from maternity leave:**
- Less favorable treatment because of pregnancy = sex discrimination (need comparator)

**Pregnancy-related illness:**
- Absence treated as sick leave (not sickness absence record that affects employment)
- Dismissal for pregnancy-related illness during protected period = automatic unfair dismissal

### Discrimination in Recruitment

#### Job Advertisements
**Must not:**
- Indicate intention to discriminate
- Use language suggesting preference for particular protected characteristic

**Exceptions:**
- Age: Can specify need for experience/qualifications linked to age
- Occupational requirement (rare)

#### Application & Selection
**Must:**
- Use objective, job-related criteria
- Apply criteria consistently
- Avoid assumptions or stereotypes

**Can't:**
- Ask discriminatory questions (e.g., "Do you plan to have children?")
- Pre-employment health questions (with narrow exceptions)

**Should:**
- Use diverse interview panels
- Structured interviews (same questions)
- Score objectively against criteria

### Occupational Requirements (Schedule 9)
**Can discriminate if:**
- Being particular protected characteristic is occupational requirement
- Application of requirement is proportionate means of achieving legitimate aim

**Genuine and determining occupational requirement** - very narrow

**Examples:**
- Religious organization requiring employee to have particular religion
- Actor of specific sex/race for authenticity
- Single-sex services (domestic violence shelter requiring female workers)

**NOT acceptable:**
- "Customer preference" (never a defense)
- "Always done this way"

---

## Redundancy

### Genuine Redundancy (ERA 1996 s.139)

**Definition:** Dismissal is by reason of redundancy if:**
1. **Employer ceases business** (entire business closing)
2. **Workplace closes** (site/location closing)
3. **Reduced requirement for employees to do work of particular kind** (at that place of employment)

**Key:** Reduction in need for employees, not just work redistribution

### Redundancy Process

#### Stage 1: Planning
**Before announcing:**
1. **Determine need:** Is redundancy genuine? Can it be avoided?
2. **Identify pool:** Which roles/employees potentially at risk?
3. **Selection criteria:** Objective, measurable, non-discriminatory
4. **Timeline:** How long will process take?
5. **Alternatives:** Redeployment opportunities? Voluntary redundancy? Reduced hours?

#### Stage 2: Consultation (Individual)

**Timing:**
- Start before final decision
- Meaningful (genuine consideration of views)
- Minimum timescales:
  - Less than 20 redundancies: No statutory minimum, but must be "meaningful" (suggest 20+ days)
  - 20+ redundancies: Collective consultation applies (see below)

**What to consult on:**
- Reasons for redundancy
- Numbers and types of employees affected
- How selection will be done
- How dismissals will be implemented
- How redundancy payments calculated

**Individual consultation meeting:**
1. **Explain situation:** Business need, numbers affected
2. **Explain selection:** Criteria and how applied
3. **Provisional scoring:** Share employee's scores
4. **Alternatives:** Discuss redeployment, voluntary redundancy
5. **Give time to respond:** Employee can challenge selection/scoring
6. **Consider representations:** Genuinely review any challenges

**Follow-up:**
- Second meeting if needed (especially if employee challenged)
- Outcome meeting: Confirm redundancy or confirm job safe

#### Stage 3: Selection

**Fair selection criteria (objective and measurable):**
- Skills, qualifications, experience
- Performance/disciplinary record (if well-documented)
- Attendance (exclude pregnancy, disability-related, family leave)
- Aptitude assessments

**Unfair criteria:**
- Trade union membership
- Part-time vs full-time (indirect sex discrimination risk)
- Pregnancy/maternity
- Disability-related
- "Last in, first out" (LIFO) - age discrimination risk unless justified

**Scoring:**
- Score each employee against criteria
- Matrix approach (objective evidence)
- Document rationale
- Allow employees to see/challenge scores

**Discrimination risks:**
- Don't let protected characteristics influence selection
- Be cautious with attendance (disability/pregnancy)
- Be cautious with flexibility (may disadvantage women)

#### Stage 4: Notice of Redundancy

**Letter contents:**
- Confirmation of redundancy
- Effective date (notice period applies)
- Reason for redundancy (business need)
- Why employee selected
- Redundancy payment amount
- Payment of outstanding holiday
- Right to appeal (deadline, who to appeal to)
- Offer to discuss redeployment (if any opportunities)

**Notice period:**
- Statutory minimum: 1 week per year (max 12 weeks)
- Contractual notice: Whichever is longer
- Pay in lieu of notice (PILON): If contract allows

**Garden leave:**
- Can place on garden leave during notice
- Still employed (accruing rights)
- Redundancy payment based on termination date, not garden leave start

#### Stage 5: Redundancy Payment

**Statutory redundancy pay (2+ years service):**

**Calculation:**
- 0.5 week's pay for each full year under age 22
- 1 week's pay for each full year age 22-40
- 1.5 weeks' pay for each full year age 41+
- Maximum 20 years counted
- Week's pay capped (£643 from April 2024 - CHECK CURRENT)

**Example:**
Employee age 45, 10 years service, £800/week actual pay:
- Years 35-40: 5 years × 1 week × £643 = £3,215
- Years 41-45: 5 years × 1.5 weeks × £643 = £4,822.50
- Total: £8,037.50

**Tax treatment:**
- First £30,000 tax-free
- Remainder taxable as income

**Enhanced redundancy:**
- Employer can pay more than statutory
- Should have policy to ensure fairness

### Collective Redundancy Consultation (TULRCA 1992)

**Triggers:**
- 20+ employees at one establishment within 90 days = collective consultation
- Establishment: Single workplace/unit (not whole company if multiple sites)

**Timescales:**
- **20-99 redundancies:** Minimum 30 days before first dismissal
- **100+ redundancies:** Minimum 45 days before first dismissal

**Who to consult:**
- Recognized trade union (if any)
- If no union: Elected employee representatives

**What to consult on (TULRCA s.188):**
1. Ways to avoid dismissals
2. Ways to reduce numbers
3. Ways to mitigate consequences
4. How selection will be done

**Consultation must be:**
- With view to reaching agreement
- Undertaken in good faith
- Information disclosed in writing

**Information to provide:**
- Reasons for redundancy
- Numbers and descriptions of affected employees
- Total numbers employed at establishment
- Proposed method of selection
- Proposed method of carrying out dismissals (timing, redundancy payments)

**HR1 Form:**
- Notify government (Insolvency Service) when 20+ redundancies
- Before consultation starts (or ASAP after)
- Failure: Criminal offense + protective award risk

**Protective Award:**
- If fail to consult or consult inadequately: Tribunal can order payment
- Up to 90 days' gross pay per affected employee (uncapped)
- High cost of non-compliance!

### Alternatives to Redundancy

**Before redundancy, consider:**

**1. Recruitment freeze**
- Stop hiring externally
- Redeploy internally

**2. Voluntary redundancy**
- Ask for volunteers
- Enhanced terms may encourage uptake
- Risk: Lose best performers
- Still need fair selection if not enough volunteers

**3. Redeployment**
- Suitable alternative employment
- Must actively seek and offer
- Can be lower grade (with agreement)
- Trial period: 4 weeks statutory (can extend by agreement)

**4. Reduced hours**
- Job sharing, shorter working week
- Need agreement (contract variation)

**5. Lay-off or short-time working**
- Temporary reduction/cessation
- Only if contract allows
- Limits on duration

**6. Salary reduction**
- Need agreement (contract variation)
- Consider alternatives first

### Redundancy Pitfalls

**Common errors:**
- ❌ No genuine redundancy (just want rid of employee)
- ❌ Inadequate/sham consultation
- ❌ Unfair selection criteria
- ❌ Not considering alternatives
- ❌ Making position redundant, then recruiting similar role
- ❌ Discriminatory selection
- ❌ Poor documentation

**Tribunal will scrutinize:**
- Was redundancy genuine?
- Was pool selection fair?
- Was selection criteria objective and applied fairly?
- Was consultation meaningful?
- Were alternatives considered?

## TUPE Transfers

### Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006

**What is TUPE?**
TUPE preserves employees' terms when business (or part) transfers from one employer to another.

**When does TUPE apply?**

**1. Business transfer (Regulation 3(1)(a)):**
- Transfer of economic entity
- Entity retains identity after transfer
- Organized grouping of resources/employees

**Example:** Company A sells business to Company B

**2. Service provision change (Regulation 3(1)(b)):**
- **Outsourcing:** Client engages contractor to do work previously done in-house
- **Re-tendering:** Work moves from Contractor A to Contractor B
- **Insourcing:** Client brings work back in-house

**Requirements for service provision change:**
- Activities fundamentally the same before/after
- Immediately before transfer, organized grouping of employees with principal purpose of doing activities
- Client intends activities to be done by transferee

### TUPE Effects

**Automatic transfer:**
- Employment transfers automatically (employees can't object except to dismiss themselves)
- Terms and conditions preserved (contracts transfer "as is")
- Continuity of employment preserved
- Collective agreements transfer

**What transfers:**
- All contractual terms
- All employees assigned to transferring entity (immediately before transfer)
- Accrued rights (holiday, notice)
- Liabilities (arrears, tribunal claims)

**What doesn't transfer:**
- Occupational pension rights (some exceptions)
- Criminal liabilities

### Employee Information and Consultation

**Obligation on both transferor and transferee:**

**Information to provide (Regulation 13):**
- Fact of transfer (when, reasons)
- Legal, economic, social implications
- Measures envisaged in connection with transfer
- If other party envisages measures: what they are

**Timing:**
- Long enough before transfer for consultation (if needed)
- Practical: 2-4 weeks minimum

**To whom:**
- Recognized union, or
- Elected employee representatives, or
- If no reps: Directly to affected employees

**Failure:**
- Complaint to tribunal
- Award up to 13 weeks' gross pay per affected employee

### Consultation (if measures envisaged)

**"Measures":** Any action/change concerning employees

**Examples:**
- Changes to terms
- Redundancies
- Relocations
- Changes to working practices

**Consultation must:**
- Be with view to reaching agreement
- Consider representations
- Give reasons if rejected

### Dismissals and TUPE

**Automatically unfair if sole or principal reason is:**
- Transfer itself, OR
- Reason connected with transfer (unless economic, technical, or organizational reason entailing changes in workforce - "ETO reason")

**ETO reason:**
- **Economic:** Financial (e.g., cost reduction)
- **Technical:** Technical processes (e.g., new equipment)
- **Organizational:** Organization of workforce (e.g., structure change)
- **Entailing changes in workforce:** Changes in numbers or job functions

**If ETO + changes in workforce:**
- Dismissal potentially fair (not automatic unfair)
- Still must follow fair procedure
- Still need fair reason (usually redundancy or SOSR)

**Examples:**
- ❌ Transfer itself: Automatically unfair
- ❌ "Fresh start" with new team: Automatically unfair (no ETO)
- ✅ Genuine redundancy (reduced need): ETO - potentially fair if procedure followed
- ✅ Harmonization of terms (requiring dismissal/re-engagement): ETO if genuine organizational reason

### Varying Terms Post-TUPE

**General rule:** Can't vary terms if sole/principal reason is transfer

**Exceptions:**
1. **Agreement for unconnected reason:** If variation unrelated to transfer (hard to prove)
2. **ETO reason:** If variation for ETO reason entailing workforce changes
3. **Less favorable overall:** If overall package improves

**Practical approach:**
- Wait significant time post-transfer (6+ months)
- Genuine business reason unconnected to transfer
- Consult, get agreement if possible
- If refusing: Consider dismissal and re-engagement (risks!)

### TUPE Checklist

**Pre-Transfer - Transferor:**
- [ ] Identify affected employees
- [ ] Prepare employee liability information (Regulation 11)

## Contracts & Variations

### Employment Contracts - Key Terms

#### Express Terms
**Written terms (legally required statement - s.1 ERA 1996):**

**Must be provided within 2 months (from April 2020: Day 1 for some terms):**

**Day 1 terms:**
- Name of employer and employee
- Job title or description
- Start date
- Continuous employment date (if different)
- Pay (amount, frequency)
- Hours of work
- Holiday entitlement
- Place of work (or if mobile)

**Within 2 months:**
- Notice periods (to give and receive)
- Pension arrangements
- Collective agreements
- If temporary: End date or expected duration
- Probation terms (if applicable)

**Disciplinary and grievance:**
- No longer need to provide full procedures in statement
- Must say where to find them or who to contact

#### Implied Terms

**Terms implied by law:**
- Mutual trust and confidence (employer won't act in manner calculated to destroy relationship)
- Duty of fidelity (employee won't compete, disclose confidential info)
- Obey reasonable and lawful orders
- Take reasonable care and skill
- Provide work (in some cases, e.g., commission-based roles)
- Pay wages (employer)
- Provide safe system of work (employer)

**Terms implied by custom and practice:**
- Long-standing practices (e.g., Christmas bonus if always given)
- Criteria: Reasonable, notorious (well-known), certain

**Terms implied by fact (business efficacy):**
- Necessary to make contract work
- "Officious bystander test" - so obvious it goes without saying

### Varying Contracts

**Principle:** Variation requires mutual agreement

#### Consensual Variation
**Best approach:**
1. Propose change (explain reason)
2. Consult (listen to concerns)
3. Negotiate if necessary
4. Get agreement in writing

**Consideration needed:**
- Continuing employment = sufficient consideration
- Or offer something (pay rise, additional holiday)

#### Unilateral Variation
**Risky!** Can lead to constructive dismissal claim

**When employer might try:**
- Mobility clause (move location if contract allows)
- Flexibility clause (vary duties if contract allows)
- Change collective agreement (if contract incorporates)

**Limitations:**
- Must be express clause in contract
- Must exercise reasonably (implied term of trust and confidence)
- Can't fundamentally alter contract

**Example:**
- Contract: "Employer may require you to work at any UK location"
- Can relocate BUT must give reasonable notice and not act unreasonably
- May need to consider personal circumstances

#### Dismissal and Re-Engagement
**Last resort** if can't agree variation

**Process:**
1. Consult on proposed changes
2. Try to reach agreement
3. If not: Give notice of dismissal
4. Offer re-engagement on new terms

**Risks:**
- Unfair dismissal claim (if 2+ years)
- Breach of contract claim (if no notice)
- Discrimination claim (if affects protected characteristic group)

**Fair reason:**
- Usually "Some Other Substantial Reason" (SOSR)
- Or redundancy (if reduced need for old role)

**Reasonableness (s.98(4)):**
- Business need genuine?
- Consultation adequate?
- Notice given?
- New terms reasonable?

**Example - potentially fair:**
- Business need to change shift patterns (cost saving)
- Consulted for 3 months
- Most employees agreed
- Offered trial period
- Held-outs dismissed with notice and offered new terms
- Tribunal may find fair

### Restrictive Covenants

**Post-termination restrictions:**
- Non-compete
- Non-solicitation (clients/employees)
- Non-dealing (with clients)
- Non-poaching (employees)
- Confidentiality (always implied anyway)

**Enforceability:**
Only enforceable if:
1. **Legitimate business interest** to protect (confidential info, client connections, workforce stability)
2. **Reasonable** in scope:
   - Duration (3-12 months typical, 6 months common)
   - Geography (area where actually compete)
   - Activities (can't be too wide)
3. **Not against public interest** (shouldn't prevent earning living)

**Drafting tips:**
- Be specific (type of clients, type of business)
- Tailor to role (senior = broader, junior = narrower)
- Include severance clause (if one unenforceable, others survive)
- Consider garden leave (alternative to restriction)

**Enforcement:**
- Injunction (prevent breach)
- Damages (if breached)
- High cost and uncertain outcome
- Often settle with ex-employee's new employer

**Garden leave as alternative:**
- During notice period, don't work but still employed
- Can't compete (still employed so duty of fidelity)
- More certain than post-termination restriction
- Must pay full salary

---

## Sickness & Capability

### Managing Short-Term Sickness Absence

**Purpose:** Improve attendance while being fair and lawful

**Process:**

#### 1. Trigger Points
**Typical triggers:**
- X absences in 12 months (e.g., 3 or 4)
- X days in 12 months (e.g., 10 days)
- Pattern (e.g., Fridays/Mondays, after holidays)

**Trigger = review, not automatic disciplinary**

#### 2. Return-to-Work Interviews
**After every absence:**
- Welcome back
- Ask about absence (concern, not interrogation)
- Confirm reason fits with self-certification/fit note
- Discuss support needed
- Record discussion

**Benefits:**
- Shows absence monitored
- Identifies patterns/issues
- Supports employee
- Deters low-level abuse

#### 3. Absence Review Meeting (if trigger hit)
**Purpose:** Discuss absence level, explore support, set expectations

**Meeting:**
- Review absence record
- Discuss reasons (any underlying issues?)
- Explore:
  - Health issues? (consider Occupational Health referral)
  - Workplace issues? (address if so)
  - Personal issues? (support if possible)
- Agree way forward:
  - Improvement expected (clear target)
  - Review period (e.g., 3-6 months)
  - Consequence if no improvement (further action)

**Outcome letter:**
- Summary of discussion
- Improvement required
- Review period
- Support offered
- Consequences

#### 4. If No Improvement
**Capability procedure:**
- Further review meeting
- Warning (first, then final)
- If still no improvement: Dismissal

**Key:**
- Not disciplinary (capability, not conduct)
- Be supportive but clear about expectations
- Document throughout

### Managing Long-Term Sickness

**Longer absence (4+ weeks typically) = different approach**

#### 1. Maintain Contact
- Regular contact (not excessive, not absent)
- Check on welfare
- Keep informed about workplace
- Discuss when might return

#### 2. Obtain Medical Evidence
**Fit notes:**
- After 7 days: Fit note from doctor
- States "not fit for work" or "may be fit for work" (with adjustments)

**Occupational Health (OH) referral:**
- When: Uncertainty about return, need for adjustments
- With employee consent (but can proceed without if reasonable - GDPR compliant)
- Questions to OH:
  - Is condition a disability (Equality Act)?
  - What is prognosis?
  - When likely to return?
  - What adjustments might help?
  - Is currently fit for any work?

#### 3. Consider Adjustments
**If disability or may be disability:**
- Duty to make reasonable adjustments
- Examples: Phased return, reduced hours, different duties, equipment

**If not disability:**
- No legal duty, but good practice
- Supports return to work
- May avoid dismissal

#### 4. Consultation Meetings
**Before considering dismissal:**
- Meet employee (at home if can't attend workplace)
- Discuss medical evidence
- Discuss prognosis
- Explore alternatives:
  - Adjusted role?
  - Phased return?
  - Alternative role?
- Warn: If can't return, may need to consider dismissal

#### 5. Decision to Dismiss (Capability)
**Fair if:**
- No reasonable prospect of return within reasonable time
- Considered adjustments
- Considered alternative roles
- Business need to fill position
- Consulted employee

**Reasonable time:**
- Depends: Size of business, nature of role, how long absent already
- No fixed rule (6 months? 12 months? Case by case)

**Dismissal letter:**
- Reason: Capability (ill health)
- Medical evidence relied on
- Consultation undertaken
- Alternatives considered
- Notice period
- Right to appeal

### Fit Notes: "May Be Fit For Work"

**If fit note says "may be fit" with adjustments:**
- Discuss with employee
- Consider adjustments (phased return, amended duties, workplace adaptations, altered hours)
- Decide:
  - **Accept adjustments:** Pay full pay (employee available for work)
  - **Reject adjustments:** If not reasonable, employee remains off sick (SSP only)

### Statutory Sick Pay (SSP)

**Eligibility:**
- Employee or worker
- Earning above Lower Earnings Limit (£123/week from April 2024 - CHECK CURRENT)
- Off sick 4+ consecutive days (including non-working days)
- Provided fit note after 7 days

**Rate:**
- £116.75/week (from April 2024 - CHECK CURRENT)
- Up to 28 weeks
- No SSP for first 3 days (waiting days)

**Employer pays:**
- Can no longer recover from government (unless small employer percentage scheme if applicable)

**Contractual sick pay:**
- Many employers pay more than SSP (occupational sick pay)
- Common: Full pay for X weeks, half pay for Y weeks
- Check contract

### Disability Discrimination in Sickness

**Key risks:**
- Dismissing for disability-related absence
- Failing to make reasonable adjustments
- Harassment due to disability

**Protections:**
- Discrimination arising from disability (s.15 Equality Act)
  - Unfavorable treatment because of something arising from disability
  - Defense: Didn't know and couldn't reasonably have known about disability
  - Or: Treatment was proportionate means to legitimate aim

**Example:**
- Dismissing for high absence is "unfavorable treatment"
- If absence due to disability = discrimination arising from disability
- Unless: Didn't know it was disability, OR dismissal was proportionate (rare to justify)

**To avoid:**
- Get medical evidence (is it a disability?)
- Make reasonable adjustments
- Consider redeployment
- Don't treat disability-related absence same as ordinary absence

### Negotiating Settlement

**From employer's side:**

**Benefits of settlement:**

### COT3 Agreements (ACAS)

**Alternative to settlement agreement:**

  - ACAS officer involved
  - Employee understood what giving up

**When used:**

## Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Unfair Dismissal - Inadequate Investigation

**Facts:**
- Employee X, 5 years' service
- Till shortages reported over 3 months (£500 total)
- Manager suspected X of theft
- Invited X to disciplinary hearing (allegation: theft)
- Hearing: Presented evidence (till shortage reports), X denied, dismissed for gross misconduct

**Issue:** Was investigation adequate?

**Analysis:**
- **Burchell test:** (1) Reasonable investigation? (2) Reasonable belief in guilt? (3) Reasonable decision?
- **Investigation flaws:**
  - No CCTV reviewed
  - No witnesses interviewed (other till operators had access)
  - No consideration of other explanations (errors, other staff)
  - No consideration of patterns (which shifts, which tills)
- Shortfall in investigation = insufficient to form reasonable belief
- Decision to dismiss unreasonable

**Outcome:** Unfair dismissal likely
**Compensation:** Basic award + compensatory award (probably 3-6 months' pay)

**Lesson:** Thorough investigation essential, even for suspected dishonesty

---

### Case Study 2: Discrimination - Pregnancy

**Facts:**
- Employee Y, 1 year's service, marketing executive
- Announces pregnancy (12 weeks)
- 2 weeks later: Made redundant (role "no longer needed")
- Company hires marketing consultant 1 month later (same duties)

**Issues:**
1. Automatic unfair dismissal (pregnancy)?
2. Pregnancy discrimination?

**Analysis:**

**Automatic unfair dismissal (s.99 ERA 1996):**
- Dismissal during pregnancy
- Reason for dismissal: Ostensibly "redundancy"
- But: Replacement hired = redundancy not genuine
- If principal reason is pregnancy → automatic unfair dismissal

**Pregnancy discrimination (Equality Act):**
- Less favorable treatment because of pregnancy
- Timing suspicious (2 weeks after announcement)
- Replacement hired (role still needed)
- Prima facie case of discrimination
- Burden shifts to employer to prove non-discriminatory reason
- Here: Can't prove (replacement hired)

**Outcome:** Automatic unfair dismissal + pregnancy discrimination
**Compensation:**
- Unfair dismissal: Basic award + compensatory award (loss of earnings, uncapped for automatic unfair dismissal)
- Discrimination: Injury to feelings (middle/upper band) + financial loss (uncapped) + interest

**Lesson:** Dismissing pregnant employee is extremely risky. Must have genuine, well-documented reason unrelated to pregnancy.

---

### Case Study 3: Constructive Dismissal - Unilateral Pay Cut

**Facts:**
- Employee Z, 3 years' service, sales manager
- Contract: £40,000 basic + uncapped commission
- Company announces: New commission structure (reduces commission by ~30%)
- Z objects, company says "take it or leave it"
- Z resigns, claims constructive dismissal

**Issues:**
1. Fundamental breach of contract?
2. Resignation in response to breach?

**Analysis:**

**Breach of contract:**
- Unilateral variation of contractual term (commission)
- Significant reduction (30%)
- No agreement from Z
- = Repudiatory breach (fundamental breach going to root of contract)

**Resignation in response:**
- Z resigned shortly after (didn't affirm breach)
- Resignation explicitly in response to change
- = Constructive dismissal

**Fair reason:**
- Employer may argue "Some Other Substantial Reason" (business reorganization)
- But: No consultation, no attempt to reach agreement, sudden imposition
- Unreasonable (s.98(4)) - didn't act within band of reasonable responses

**Outcome:** Unfair constructive dismissal
**Compensation:** Basic award + compensatory award (loss of earnings including lost commission)

**Lesson:** Can't unilaterally change contract terms (especially pay). Must consult, try to agree, consider dismissal and re-engagement if no agreement (with risks).

---

### Case Study 4: Disability Discrimination - Reasonable Adjustments

**Facts:**
- Employee A, 2 years' service, warehouse operative
- Diagnosis: Type 1 diabetes (disability under Equality Act)
- Needs regular breaks to test blood sugar and eat
- Requests: Flexible break times (not fixed breaks)
- Manager refuses: "Everyone has same breaks, can't make exceptions"
- A's condition worsens, takes sick leave
- Dismissed for capability (excessive absence)

**Issues:**
1. Reasonable adjustments duty breached?
2. Discrimination arising from disability?
3. Unfair dismissal?

**Analysis:**

**Reasonable adjustments (s.20):**
- PCP: Fixed break times
- Substantial disadvantage: A can't manage condition without flexible breaks
- Reasonable adjustment: Allow flexible breaks (not costly, not disruptive)
- Employer refused = breach of duty
- = Disability discrimination (can't justify failure to make adjustment)

**Discrimination arising from disability (s.15):**
- Unfavorable treatment: Dismissal
- Because of something arising from disability: Excessive absence (caused by unmanaged diabetes)
- Knowledge: Employer knew about diabetes
- = Discrimination arising from disability
- Defense (proportionate means to legitimate aim): Not available here - employer caused the absence by refusing adjustment

**Unfair dismissal:**
- Capability dismissal (ill health)
- But: Employer's fault (refused adjustment)
- Unreasonable to dismiss when could have avoided absence by making adjustment
- = Unfair dismissal

**Outcome:** Discrimination + unfair dismissal
**Compensation:**
- Discrimination: Injury to feelings (middle band) + financial loss (past and future) + interest
- Unfair dismissal: Basic award + compensatory award (but may be subsumed in discrimination award to avoid double recovery)

**Lesson:** Must consider and make reasonable adjustments for disabled employees. Failure = discrimination, even if dismissal appears to be for neutral reason (absence).
