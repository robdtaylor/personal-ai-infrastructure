## Workflow: Responding to HR Issues

### Step 1: Understand the Situation
Ask clarifying questions:
- **Nature of issue:** What specifically has happened?
- **Employee details:** Length of service, contract type (permanent/fixed-term), full/part-time?
- **Previous action:** What has been done so far?
- **Documentation:** What is documented?
- **Timeline:** When did this occur? Any deadlines?
- **Company size:** Number of employees (affects some obligations)?

### Step 2: Check Current Law and Guidance
**ALWAYS search for:**
```
- ACAS guidance on [specific issue]
- UK government [specific regulation] 2025
- Current [minimum wage / statutory pay] rates
- Recent tribunal cases on [issue]
```

**Key resources to reference:**
- ACAS.org.uk - Codes of Practice, guidance
- Gov.uk - Legislation, statutory rates
- CIPD.co.uk - HR best practice
- Recent Employment Tribunal decisions

### Step 3: Assess Risk
**Tribunal risk factors:**
- Length of service (2+ years for unfair dismissal claims)
- Protected characteristics involved (discrimination claims)
- Whistleblowing or protected disclosure
- Procedural fairness (ACAS Code followed?)
- Documentation quality
- Witness availability

**Risk levels:**
- 🟢 **LOW:** Procedure followed, well-documented, clear grounds
- 🟡 **MEDIUM:** Some procedural gaps, potential for challenge
- 🔴 **HIGH:** Serious procedural failures, discrimination risk, poor documentation

### Step 4: Provide Advice

**Structure:**
1. **Summary:** Brief overview of the situation
2. **Legal position:** What does the law say?
3. **Risk assessment:** Likelihood of tribunal claim and success
4. **Recommended action:** Step-by-step guidance
5. **Documentation:** What to document and how
6. **Timeline:** Deadlines and time limits
7. **Red flags:** What to avoid

**Always include:**
- ⚖️ **Legal basis** (cite specific legislation/ACAS guidance)
- 📋 **Practical steps** (what to do, what to say)
- 📝 **Documentation** (letters, forms, meeting notes)
- ⏱️ **Timelines** (statutory time limits, reasonable timescales)
- ⚠️ **Warnings** (pitfalls, risks, things to avoid)

### Step 5: Templates and Documentation
Offer relevant templates:
- Invitation to disciplinary/grievance hearing
- Outcome letters (written warning, dismissal, etc.)
- Contract variation letters
- Redundancy consultation documents
- Settlement agreement frameworks

## Common HR Issues - Quick Reference

### Dismissal
**Fair reasons:** Capability, conduct, redundancy, statutory restriction, some other substantial reason (SOSR)
**Procedure:** Investigation → disciplinary hearing → outcome → appeal
**Key:** Follow ACAS Code, reasonable investigation, fair procedure

### Disciplinary Action
**ACAS Code:** Mandatory for disciplinary/grievance
**Steps:** Investigate → invite to hearing → hearing → decision → appeal right
**Sanctions:** Informal warning → written warning → final written warning → dismissal

### Grievance
**Duty:** Handle grievances reasonably and without unreasonable delay
**Procedure:** Receive grievance → investigate → grievance meeting → outcome → appeal
**Mediator:** Consider ACAS mediation for complex cases

### Redundancy
**Genuine redundancy:** Business closure, workplace closure, reduced workforce need
**Consultation:** Individual (20+ days) or collective (30/45 days for 20+ dismissals)
**Selection:** Fair, objective criteria; avoid discrimination
**Payment:** Statutory redundancy pay (capped) + notice

### Discrimination
**Protected characteristics:** Age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage/civil partnership, pregnancy/maternity, race, religion/belief, sex, sexual orientation
**Types:** Direct, indirect, harassment, victimization
**Defense:** Occupational requirement (limited), proportionate means to legitimate aim (indirect only)

### Sickness Absence
**Short-term:** Trigger points, return-to-work interviews, occupational health
**Long-term:** Medical evidence, reasonable adjustments (disability), capability procedure
**Dismissal:** Fair if: genuine incapability, consulted employee, considered alternatives

### Performance Management
**Process:** Set clear objectives → regular reviews → support/training → improvement plan → capability procedure if no improvement
**Capability dismissal:** Fair if reasonable investigation, warnings given, improvement opportunity provided

## Current Rates (Must Verify)

**Before advising on pay, ALWAYS search for current rates:**

```
Example search: "UK national minimum wage rates 2025"
```

**Typical rates to check:**
- National Living Wage (23+)
- National Minimum Wage (under 23, apprentice)
- Statutory Sick Pay (SSP)
- Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP)
- Statutory Paternity Pay (SPP)
- Statutory Redundancy Pay (calculation and cap)
- Tribunal compensation caps (unfair dismissal, discrimination)

## Key Legislation Reference

- **Employment Rights Act 1996** - Core employment rights
- **Equality Act 2010** - Discrimination law
- **Working Time Regulations 1998** - Hours, rest breaks, holidays
- **National Minimum Wage Act 1998** - Pay floors
- **Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1992** - Collective rights, TUPE
- **Data Protection Act 2018 / UK GDPR** - Employee data
