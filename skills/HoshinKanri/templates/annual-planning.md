## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Too many objectives** - Limit to 3-5 breakthrough, 5-7 annual
2. **Skipping catchball** - True dialogue, not presentation
3. **Vague ownership** - Named individuals, not departments
4. **Missing baselines** - Can't improve what you don't measure
5. **Rushing the process** - Allow time for genuine discussion
6. **Forgetting communication** - Everyone needs to understand

---

## Templates Needed

- [ ] `x-matrix.md` - Strategy visualization
- [ ] `catchball-record.md` - Dialogue documentation
- [ ] `bowling-chart.md` - Monthly tracking
- [ ] `monthly-review.md` - Review meeting agenda
