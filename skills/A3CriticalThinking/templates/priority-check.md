## Quick Reference Card

```
STOP AND ASK:

S - SAFETY: Is anyone at risk?
    → If yes: STOP, address safety first

T - TARGET: What are we trying to achieve?
    → Define success clearly

O - OPTIONS: What choices do we have?
    → List alternatives

P - PRIORITY: Apply hierarchy
    → Safety → Quality → Cost
```

**When in doubt: STOP PRODUCTION**
It is always better to stop and ask than to proceed unsafely.
