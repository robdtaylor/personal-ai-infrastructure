# Decision Matrix Template

**Decision:** [What options are being evaluated]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Decision Owner:** [Name]

## Priority Hierarchy Reminder

All options must first pass the priority check:
1. **Safety** - Must be safe (eliminate unsafe options)
2. **Quality** - Must meet customer requirements (eliminate non-compliant options)
3. **Cost** - Then optimize (use this matrix)

---

## Step 1: Screen Options for Safety & Quality

Before comparing options, eliminate any that fail basic requirements:

| Option | Safe? | Meets Quality? | Include in Matrix? |
|--------|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| Option A | Y/N | Y/N | |
| Option B | Y/N | Y/N | |
| Option C | Y/N | Y/N | |
| Option D | Y/N | Y/N | |

**Only options with YES/YES proceed to comparison.**

## Step 2: Define Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Weight (1-10) | Description |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Safety margin | | Beyond minimum requirements |
| Quality improvement | | Better than current |
| Implementation cost | | Capital and expense |
| Operating cost | | Ongoing expense |
| Implementation time | | Speed to deploy |
| Risk level | | Probability of failure |
| Sustainability | | Long-term viability |

**Note:** Weights should reflect priority hierarchy - safety criteria weighted highest.

## Step 3: Score Options

Scale: 1 (Poor) to 10 (Excellent)

| Criterion | Weight | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|-----------|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| | | Score / Weighted | Score / Weighted | Score / Weighted |
| Safety margin | | / | / | / |
| Quality improvement | | / | / | / |
| Implementation cost | | / | / | / |
| Operating cost | | / | / | / |
| Implementation time | | / | / | / |
| Risk level | | / | / | / |
| Sustainability | | / | / | / |
| **TOTAL** | | **___** | **___** | **___** |

---

## Step 4: Calculate Weighted Scores

**Formula:** Weighted Score = Score × Weight

**Example:**
- Safety margin: Score 8 × Weight 10 = 80
- Cost: Score 6 × Weight 5 = 30

| Option | Total Weighted Score | Rank |
|--------|---------------------|------|
| Option A | | |
| Option B | | |
| Option C | | |

---

## Step 5: Sensitivity Analysis

**What if weights changed?**

| Scenario | Winner | Difference from base |
|----------|--------|---------------------|
| Base case | | - |
| Safety +20% | | |
| Cost +20% | | |
| Time +20% | | |

**Is the winner robust across scenarios?**
- [ ] Yes - proceed with confidence
- [ ] No - investigate sensitivity factors

## Step 6: Risk Assessment

For the recommended option:

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| | H/M/L | H/M/L | |
| | H/M/L | H/M/L | |
| | H/M/L | H/M/L | |

---

## Decision Summary

**Recommended Option:** [Name]

**Rationale:**
1. Safety: [Why this option is safest or equally safe]
2. Quality: [Why this option protects/enhances quality]
3. Cost: [Why this option is optimal for business]

**Key Risks and Mitigations:**
- [Risk 1]: [Mitigation]
- [Risk 2]: [Mitigation]

---

## Approval

| Role | Name | Approve? | Date |
|------|------|----------|------|
| Sponsor | | Y/N | |
| Safety | | Y/N | |
| Quality | | Y/N | |
| Finance | | Y/N | |

## Quick Decision Guide

**For simple decisions:**
1. Is it safe? → If no, reject
2. Does it meet quality? → If no, reject
3. Is it cost-effective? → Compare remaining options

**For complex decisions:**
1. Use full matrix above
2. Include cross-functional team
3. Document rationale for audit trail
