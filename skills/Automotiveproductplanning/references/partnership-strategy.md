# Partnership Strategy Reference

Comprehensive framework for evaluating and structuring partnerships in low-volume automotive manufacturing.

## Partnership Types

### 1. Platform Sharing

**Definition**: Using another OEM's architecture (chassis, structure, systems) as basis for your vehicle.

**Examples**:
- Toyota GR86 / Subaru BRZ (joint development)
- Fisker Ocean on Magna platform
- Historic: Lotus using Toyota/GM powertrain

**Evaluation Criteria**:

```
