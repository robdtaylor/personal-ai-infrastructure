# Analysis Frameworks

## 1. Regulatory Timeline Analysis

Map each product programme against compliance deadlines:

```
Product: [Model Name]
Target Launch: [Year]
Target Markets: [List]

Regulatory Requirements:
├─ Emissions: [Standard] — Deadline: [Date] — Status: [Compliant/Gap/TBD]
├─ Safety: [Requirements] — Deadline: [Date] — Status: [Compliant/Gap/TBD]
├─ Type Approval: [Jurisdiction] — Lead time: [Months] — Status: [Planned/In-progress/Complete]
└─ Homologation: [Markets] — Cost estimate: [£/€/$]
```

**Decision Rule**: If a programme cannot achieve compliance before deadline, either accelerate development or defer launch to next regulatory window.

## 2. Competitive Landscape Mapping

Position products on price/performance matrix:

```
                    PERFORMANCE →
              Track-focused    |    Grand Touring
         ┌────────────────────┼────────────────────┐
    HIGH │  [Competitors]     │  [Competitors]     │
PRICE    │  YOUR PRODUCT?     │                    │
    ↓    ├────────────────────┼────────────────────┤
    LOW  │  [Competitors]     │  [Competitors]     │
         └────────────────────┴────────────────────┘
```

For each quadrant, identify:
- Direct competitors (same segment, ±20% price)
- Adjacent competitors (could cross-shop)
- Emerging threats (new entrants, electrification disruptors)

**White Space Analysis**: Where are gaps in the market that align with brand positioning and capabilities?

## 3. Platform Economics Assessment

Evaluate platform sharing opportunities:

**Platform Sharing Matrix**
```
                    Shares with →
                 Model A | Model B | Model C | External
Architecture       ✓        ✓         ✓         ?
Powertrain         ✓        ✓         ✗         ?
Body structure     ✗        ✗         ✗         -
Interior           ✓        partial   ✗         -
Electronics        ✓        ✓         ✓         ?
```

**Cost Impact Assessment**:
- Unique components: Higher per-unit cost, brand differentiation
- Shared components: Lower cost, potential supplier leverage
- External sourcing: Consider licensing fees, supply risk, IP exposure

**Break-even Analysis**:
```
Platform Investment: £X million
Per-unit contribution: £Y
Break-even volume: X/Y = Z units
Planned lifetime volume: [Sum across all derivatives]
Margin above break-even: [Lifetime volume - Z] × £Y
```

## 4. Technology Readiness Evaluation

Assess maturity of key technologies for each programme:

**Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Assessment**
```
Technology: [e.g., 800V architecture]
Current TRL: [1-9]
Required TRL for production: 9
Gap: [Current - 9]
Time to close gap: [Months]
Risk level: [Low/Medium/High]
Mitigation: [Fallback option]
```

**TRL Scale Reference**:
- TRL 1-3: Research/concept
- TRL 4-6: Development/validation
- TRL 7-8: Demonstration/qualification
- TRL 9: Production-proven

**Powertrain Technology Decision Framework**:
```
Timeline: [Programme SOP Year]

Option A: ICE
├─ Pros: Known cost, proven supply chain, customer acceptance
├─ Cons: Regulatory risk, potentially stranded investment
└─ Recommended if: SOP before [regulatory deadline], market accepts ICE

Option B: Hybrid (PHEV/MHEV)
├─ Pros: Compliance bridge, customer flexibility, lower battery cost
├─ Cons: Complexity, two powertrains to develop
└─ Recommended if: Need compliance buffer, customers transitioning

Option C: BEV
├─ Pros: Future-proof, performance potential, brand positioning
├─ Cons: Range/weight trade-offs, infrastructure dependency, battery cost
└─ Recommended if: Target market has charging infrastructure, brand positioning as EV leader
```

## 5. SWOT for Product Planning

Apply specifically to product portfolio:

**Strengths** (Internal, Positive)
- Unique engineering capabilities
- Brand heritage/positioning
- Customer loyalty/order book
- Agility vs larger OEMs

**Weaknesses** (Internal, Negative)
- Scale disadvantages
- Capital constraints
- Engineering bandwidth
- Supplier dependencies

**Opportunities** (External, Positive)
- Market gaps from OEM retreat
- Electrification disruption
- New customer segments
- Adjacent market entry

**Threats** (External, Negative)
- Regulatory acceleration
- New entrants (Chinese EV, tech companies)
- Economic downturn impact on luxury segment
- Supply chain disruption

## 6. Portfolio Balance Assessment

Evaluate overall portfolio health:

**Revenue Concentration**
- % revenue from top model
- Risk if single model underperforms

**Lifecycle Staging**
- Models in growth phase
- Models at maturity
- Models approaching end-of-life
- Pipeline to replace declining models

**Segment Coverage**
- Entry point (conquest from other brands)
- Core (volume drivers)
- Halo (brand positioning)

**Geographic Balance**
- Revenue by region
- Homologation coverage
- Market-specific variants planned
