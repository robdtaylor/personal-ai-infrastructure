### Type Approval

- WVTA (Whole Vehicle Type Approval) lead time: 12-18 months
- Derogations available for small-volume manufacturers (<1,000 units/year)
- National Small Series limits vary by member state

| Area | Requirement | Timeline |
|------|-------------|----------|
| UKCA marking | Required for GB market | In force |
| GB Type Approval | Separate from EU WVTA | Required |
| Provisional approval | Available for low volumes | Currently available |

### Emissions

- Broadly aligned with Euro standards but divergence possible
- UK ZEV mandate: 22% of sales must be zero emission by 2024, escalating annually
- ICE ban: 2030 for new petrol/diesel cars (hybrid allowed until 2035)

### Safety

- Currently mirroring EU GSR requirements
- Monitoring for future divergence

## United States

### Federal (NHTSA/EPA)

### State Level

| State | Requirement | Timeline |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| California (CARB) | ZEV mandate, ACC II | Leading indicator |
| §177 states | Follow CARB | ~15 states |
| Colorado, others | ZEV mandates | Various |

### Low Volume Exemptions

- EPA: Small volume manufacturer exemptions available
- NHTSA: Replica car exemptions, low-volume exemptions (325 vehicles/year)
- CARB: Limited ZEV credit provisions for small manufacturers

## China

| Requirement | Timeline | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| China 6b | In effect | Stringent emissions |
| NEV mandates | Escalating annually | Points system |
| Local content | Various | May affect sourcing |

## Other Key Markets

### Japan

- WLTP adoption
- Safety features increasingly mandated
- Electrification incentives strong

### Middle East (GCC)

- Generally follows UN regulations
- GSO conformity requirements
- Type approval through member states

### Australia

- ADR (Australian Design Rules)
- Generally following UN/EU direction
- Type approval through DoTIRDC

## Planning Implications

### Compliance Checkpoints

For any programme, verify at each gate:

```
Programme: [Name]
SOP: [Date]
Target Markets: [List]

Compliance Status:
├─ EU
│  ├─ Emissions: [Euro X] — Required by: [Date] — Status: [✓/⚠/✗]
│  ├─ Safety: [GSR II] — Required by: [Date] — Status: [✓/⚠/✗]
│  └─ Type Approval: [WVTA/NSS] — Lead time: [Months]
│
├─ UK
│  ├─ Emissions: [Aligned/Diverged] — Status: [✓/⚠/✗]
│  ├─ Safety: [Requirements] — Status: [✓/⚠/✗]

```

### Small Volume Provisions

Most regulatory regimes offer concessions for small manufacturers:

| Market | Threshold | Benefit |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| EU | 1,000 units/year | NSS derogations |
| UK | 1,000 units/year | Provisional approval |
| US (EPA) | 10,000 units/year | Reduced testing |
| US (NHTSA) | 325 units/year | Low-volume exemption |

**Strategy**: Understand threshold limits when planning volume. Crossing thresholds triggers full compliance requirements.

## Update Cadence

Regulatory landscape changes frequently. Recommended review:
- **Quarterly**: Monitor for new proposals/amendments
- **Annually**: Full compliance audit against product plan
- **At each gate**: Verify programme still compliant
