## Operational Excellence Deep Dive

### Manufacturing Systems Mastery

A GM doesn't need to operate the equipment but must understand the system well enough to:
- Challenge assumptions from operations
- Identify constraint points
- Allocate resources effectively
- Set realistic targets

**Key Concepts to Master:**

| Concept | What GM Must Understand | Red Flags |
|---------|------------------------|-----------|
| **Takt Time** | Customer demand pace, line balance | Lines running faster than takt (building inventory) |
| **Cycle Time** | Actual processing time per unit | Large gaps between cycle and takt |
| **OEE** | Availability × Performance × Quality | Numbers that look too good, inconsistent calculation |
| **Bottleneck** | System constraint that limits output | Interventions not at the bottleneck |
| **WIP** | Work in process impacts lead time | Excessive WIP hiding problems |
| **First Pass Yield** | Quality at source | FPY vs final yield gap |

### Lean Principles for GMs

**The 8 Wastes (TIMWOODS):**
- **T**ransportation - Moving materials unnecessarily
- **I**nventory - Excess stock hiding problems
- **M**otion - Unnecessary operator movement
- **W**aiting - Idle time between processes
- **O**verproduction - Making more than customer needs
- **O**verprocessing - Doing more than required
- **D**efects - Scrap, rework, warranty
- **S**kills underutilization - Not using people's capabilities

**GM's Role in Lean:**
- Create stability before improvement (reliable processes first)
- Standardize before you optimize
- Visible leadership support (attend kaizens, gemba walks)
- Allocate resources for improvement activities
- Celebrate and communicate wins
- Hold teams accountable for sustaining gains

### Production System Assessment

**Questions to Diagnose Health:**

1. **Flow:**
   - How does material flow through the plant?
   - Where does material stop and wait?
   - What triggers production (push vs pull)?

2. **Stability:**
   - What's the unplanned downtime?
   - How often do we miss the plan?
   - How variable is quality?

3. **Standardization:**
   - Are work instructions followed?
   - Is there standard work for leaders?
   - How do we know if we're abnormal?

4. **Visual Management:**
   - Can you tell status by looking?
   - Are problems immediately visible?
   - Do metrics drive action?

5. **Problem Solving:**
   - How do we respond to problems?
   - Do countermeasures stick?
   - Is there root cause analysis or just fire-fighting?

### Quality System Oversight

**GM's Quality Responsibilities:**

| Area | GM Accountability |
|------|-------------------|
| IATF Certification | Ultimate owner - ensure system health |
| Customer Audits | Participate, demonstrate leadership commitment |
| Product Launches | Sign-off on production readiness |
| Quality Targets | Set expectations, hold team accountable |
| Quality Culture | Tone from the top - quality is non-negotiable |

**APQP Gate Reviews:**

| Gate | GM Role |
|------|---------|
| Planning | Approve resource allocation |
| Product Design | Understand design trade-offs |
| Process Design | Review investment requirements |
| Product/Process Validation | Approve launch readiness |
| Production | Hold team accountable for targets |

**Warning Signs of Quality System Weakness:**
- Repeat audit findings
- Customer complaints trending up
- Heavy reliance on inspection vs prevention
- Quality department fighting production
- No time allocated for problem solving
- "Ship and sort" mentality

### Engineering Change Management

**ECN/ECO Process Oversight:**

GMs must ensure:
- Changes are properly validated before implementation
- Customer approval obtained when required
- Cost impact analyzed and communicated
- Implementation timed to minimize disruption
- Old stock disposition planned

**Common Failure Modes:**
- Rushing changes without validation
- Not communicating to all affected parties
- Running out old material without tracking
- Cost increases not captured in pricing
- Missing customer approval requirements

### Supply Chain Strategic Decisions

**Make vs Buy Framework:**

| Factor | Make | Buy |
|--------|------|-----|
| Core competency | Core to strategy | Non-differentiating |
| Quality control | Critical, difficult to control | Manageable through supplier QA |
| Capacity | Available, utilizable | Not available or capital-intensive |
| Cost | Competitive | Lower total cost externally |
| Flexibility | Need agility | Stable, predictable demand |
| IP Protection | Proprietary | Non-sensitive |

**Inventory Strategy Decisions:**

| Situation | Strategy | Risk |
|-----------|----------|------|
| Stable demand, reliable supply | JIT/Kanban | Low |
| Volatile demand | Safety stock at FG | Medium inventory cost |
| Unreliable supply | Safety stock at RM | Medium inventory cost |
| Long lead time | Forward buy, VMI | High inventory cost |
| Custom/configurable | Component stock, ATO | Obsolescence risk |

## Commercial Mastery

### P&L Ownership

**Understanding Your Numbers:**

A GM must be able to:
1. Explain every significant variance to budget
2. Identify margin drivers and drains
3. Forecast accurately (+/- 2% of revenue)
4. Connect operational metrics to financial results
5. Articulate investment ROI

**Monthly P&L Review Structure:**

```
1. REVENUE ANALYSIS
   - Volume vs plan
   - Mix impact
   - Pricing/commercial changes
   - Customer performance

2. GROSS MARGIN BRIDGE
   - Material variance (price, usage, mix)
   - Labor variance (rate, efficiency)
   - Overhead variance (spending, volume absorption)

3. OPERATING EXPENSE REVIEW
   - Budget vs actual by category
   - Significant movements
   - Discretionary vs committed

4. CASH FLOW IMPLICATIONS

## Financial Acumen

### Reading Financial Statements

**P&L Analysis:**

| Line Item | What to Look For | Questions to Ask |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| Revenue | Mix, volume, pricing | What drove changes? |
| Material | % of sales, price vs usage | Commodity trends? Yield? |
| Labor | Efficiency, rate | Overtime? Temps? Training? |
| Overhead | Fixed vs variable | Absorption issues? |
| SG&A | % of sales, controllable | Where can we cut? |
| Operating Income | Margin trend | Sustainable? |

**Balance Sheet Awareness:**

| Item | GM Responsibility |
|------|-------------------|
| Inventory | Own the level - too high = cash tied up, too low = risk |
| AR | Support collections, understand customer terms |
| Fixed Assets | Own capital decisions, understand depreciation |
| AP | Understand payment timing, supplier terms |

**Cash Flow Management:**

```
OPERATING CASH FLOW
├── Net Income
├── + Depreciation (non-cash)
├── +/- Working Capital Changes
│   ├── Inventory (decrease = cash in)
│   ├── Receivables (decrease = cash in)
│   └── Payables (increase = cash in)
└── = Cash from Operations

INVESTING CASH FLOW
├── Capital Expenditures (cash out)
├── Asset Sales (cash in)
└── = Cash from Investing

FINANCING CASH FLOW
├── Debt Changes
├── Dividends
└── = Cash from Financing
```

### Cost Accounting Fundamentals

**Standard Costing System:**

| Cost Type | Calculation | Variance Types |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Material | Standard price × Standard usage | Price, usage, mix |
| Labor | Standard rate × Standard hours | Rate, efficiency |
| Overhead | Rate × Activity driver | Spending, volume, efficiency |

**Understanding Absorption:**

- **Over-absorption**: Produced more than planned, fixed costs spread over more units, favorable variance
- **Under-absorption**: Produced less than planned, fixed costs not fully recovered, unfavorable variance

**Margin Analysis:**

| Product | Revenue | Variable Cost | Contribution | Fixed Cost | Profit |
|---------|---------|---------------|--------------|------------|--------|
| A | 100 | 60 | 40 (40%) | 25 | 15 |
| B | 100 | 75 | 25 (25%) | 20 | 5 |

**Key Insight:** Contribution margin (%) is critical for decision-making. High-contribution products should be prioritized when capacity is constrained.

### Budgeting and Forecasting

**Annual Budget Process:**

1. **Top-Down Targets** (Corporate)
   - Revenue growth expectations
   - Margin targets
   - Cost reduction targets
   - Capital envelope

2. **Bottom-Up Build** (Plant)
   - Volume by product
   - Pricing assumptions
   - Cost projections
   - Investment needs

3. **Reconciliation**
   - Gap analysis
   - Action plans to close gaps
   - Risk assessment
   - Final commitment

**Forecasting Discipline:**

| Forecast | Horizon | Accuracy Target | Review |
|----------|---------|-----------------|--------|
| Monthly | Rest of quarter | ±2% | Weekly |
| Quarterly | Rest of year | ±5% | Monthly |
| Annual | Next year | ±10% | Quarterly |

**Common Forecasting Mistakes:**
- Sandbagging (too conservative)
- Hockey stick (backend loaded)
- Ignoring leading indicators
- Not adjusting for known changes
- Missing working day impacts
