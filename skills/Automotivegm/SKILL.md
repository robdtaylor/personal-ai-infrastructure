## P&L Management

### Understanding Your Cost Structure

```
SALES REVENUE
    - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
        • Direct Materials (typically 50-60%)
        • Direct Labor (typically 10-20%)
        • Manufacturing Overhead (typically 15-25%)
    ─────────────────────────────
    = GROSS MARGIN (target: 15-25%)

    - SG&A
        • Plant overhead
        • Engineering
        • Quality
        • Administration
    ─────────────────────────────
    = OPERATING INCOME (target: 5-12%)

    - Interest, taxes, depreciation
    ─────────────────────────────
    = NET INCOME
```

2. **Productivity** - Labor efficiency, OEE improvement
